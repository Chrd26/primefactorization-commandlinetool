# primefactorization-commandlinetool
This is a CLI tool I created for learning. The program is made in C++ and tells the user if the input number is composite or prime and applies prime factorization to it.

# Usage

Download the repo and use the following command command:

**This is a GCC command. On Linux and macOS GCC is needed, on Windows minGW is needed**
g++ -std=c++20 main.cpp factorization_helpers.cpp -o app
